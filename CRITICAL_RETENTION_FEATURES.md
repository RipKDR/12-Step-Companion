## 🎯 Top 8 Research-Backed Features That Drive Actual Usage

### 1. **Daily Pledge & Reflection System** ⭐⭐⭐ CRITICAL
**Why It Works**:

**Expected Impact**: 5-10x higher retention for users who form daily habits

### 3. **Sponsor Connection (Real-Time)** ⭐⭐⭐ CRITICAL

### 4. **Immediate Value on First Use** ⭐⭐⭐ CRITICAL

**What to Build**:
- Onboarding provides value in < 2 minutes:
  - Set clean date → See immediate streak counter

- All core features work offline (already planned - CRITICAL to execute well)
- Local SQLite database
- Background sync when internet available
- Offline resources (meditations, breathing exercises)
- Offline meeting database (periodic updates)

**Expected Impact**: 50-70% higher retention than online-only apps

---

### 6. **Crisis Support (SOS Mode)** ⭐⭐⭐ CRITICAL
**Why It Works**:
- Users who feel supported during crises are more likely to continue using apps

### 8. **Simplicity & Ease of Use** ⭐⭐ HIGH IMPACT
**Why It Works**:
