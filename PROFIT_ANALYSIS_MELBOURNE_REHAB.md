  - Diversify: Don't rely on single B2B client

  - Continuous user feedback loop

### **Risk 5: AOD Job + App = Burnout**

### **Risk 6: Competitor Launches Similar App**
- **Probability**: Low-Medium (20-30%)
- **Impact**: Market share loss, pricing pressure

### **Year 2 Projections**

**Assumptions:**

### **Year 3 Projections** (Potential Full-Time Transition)

## Bottom Line: Is This Worth It?

### **Financial Perspective:**

**Year 1 ROI:**
- **Time investment**: 120-200 hours pre-launch + 10-15 hrs/month = ~300 hours total
- **Financial investment**: $6,000-8,000
- **Return**: $7,800-$23,900 app profit
- **Hourly rate from app**: $26-$80/hour (on top of salary)

**Not bad, but not life-changing in Year 1.**

### **Strategic Perspective:**

**This is a LONG-TERM PLAY:**
- Year 1: Prove concept, build user base, establish B2B relationships
- Year 2: Scale to $30-50k app revenue, increase salary leverage
- Year 3: Potential $100k+ app revenue, consider full-time transition
- Year 4-5: Potential $200k+ revenue, hire team, scale nationally

### **Impact Perspective:**

**Non-financial benefits:**
- Help hundreds/thousands in recovery (immeasurable value)
- Build reputation in addiction treatment field
- Create an asset (app has sell value if successful)
- Portfolio for future opportunities
- Personal fulfillment (you're in recovery, helping others)

---

## Final Recommendation

### **YES, this is worth pursuing, BUT:**

1. **Don't quit your day job** - The AOD counselor salary is your foundation
2. **Keep expectations realistic** - Year 1 is about validation, not wealth
3. **Focus on outcomes** - Clinical results will sell B2B partnerships
4. **Build for retention** - 97% of recovery apps fail; don't be one of them
5. **Start small, iterate fast** - Launch MVP, improve based on real usage
6. **Network relentlessly** - NA community + treatment centers = growth
7. **Think 3-5 years** - This becomes lucrative in Year 3+, not Year 1

### **Your Year 1 Realistic Profit: AUD $75,000-$85,000 total income**

This is a **12-20% increase** over just being an AOD counselor, with significant upside in Years 2-3.

**The real question isn't "How much in Year 1?" but "Can this become a $150k+ income by Year 3?"**

**Answer: Yes, if you execute well and the retention features work.**

---

## Questions to Validate This Analysis

Before committing, you should:

1. **Confirm AOD counselor salary range** in Melbourne (check SEEK, Indeed)
2. **Talk to rehab directors** about software budgets (are they willing to pay?)
3. **Survey NA members** in Melbourne (would they use this? pay for premium?)
4. **Analyze competitor pricing** (can you compete at $6.99/month?)
5. **Assess your capacity** (can you realistically do both jobs well?)
6. **Review your financial needs** (is $75-85k enough for Year 1?)

**If the answers are positive, this is a solid opportunity.**

**Good luck! This could genuinely help thousands in recovery while building a sustainable income. That's rare and valuable.**

**Let me know if you want me to dig deeper into any specific area (B2B sales strategies, pricing models, user acquisition tactics, etc.)**
