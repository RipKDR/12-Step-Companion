## 🎯 Category 1: Early Warning System & Relapse Detection

### 1. **Relapse Warning Signs Tracker** ⭐⭐⭐ CRITICAL
**Research**: Relapse happens in 3 stages - catching it early prevents physical relapse

**How It Works**:
- **Emotional Relapse Signs** (track daily):
  - Bottling up emotions
  - Isolation from others
  - Poor eating habits
  - Poor sleep patterns
  - Skipping meetings
  - Not asking for help
- **Mental Relapse Signs** (track when they occur):
  - Cravings for drugs/alcohol
  - Nostalgic feelings about using
  - Lying to self about consequences
  - Bargaining ("just one time")
  - Thinking about people/places/things associated with use
- **Physical Relapse Signs** (immediate intervention):
  - Planning to use
  - Seeking out substances
  - Actual use

**Implementation**:
- Daily check-in: "How are you feeling?" (emotional signs)
- Weekly assessment: "Any cravings or thoughts about using?" (mental signs)
- Risk score calculation based on signs
- Automatic alerts when risk increases
- Sponsor notification (with consent) when risk is high
- Action plan automatically suggested when signs detected

**Why It Works**: Early detection allows intervention before physical relapse occurs.

---

### 2. **Risk Score & Predictive Analytics** ⭐⭐⭐ CRITICAL
**Research**: Patterns predict relapse risk - early intervention prevents relapse

**How It Works**:
- Calculate risk score based on:
  - Warning signs present
  - Recent behavior changes (missed meetings, entries, routines)
  - Trigger exposure
  - Stress levels
  - Sleep quality
  - Social support engagement
- Risk levels: Low (0-30), Moderate (31-60), High (61-80), Critical (81-100)
- Visual risk indicator (traffic light: green/yellow/red)
- Trend analysis: "Your risk has increased 20% this week"

**Implementation**:
- Daily risk calculation
- Weekly trend analysis
- Alerts when risk increases significantly
- Personalized recommendations based on risk factors
- Sponsor dashboard shows risk level (with consent)

**Why It Works**: Awareness of risk level motivates preventive action.

  - "Stress levels above 7 correlate with cravings"
  - "Poor sleep (under 6 hours) increases risk"
- Proactive alerts: "Based on your patterns, this week might be challenging"
- Personalized recommendations: "Here's your Action Plan for Friday"

**Implementation**:
- Machine learning analysis of user patterns
