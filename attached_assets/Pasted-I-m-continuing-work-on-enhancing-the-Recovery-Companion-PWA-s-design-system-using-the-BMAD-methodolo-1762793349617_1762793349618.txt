I'm continuing work on enhancing the Recovery Companion PWA's design system using the BMAD methodology. The BASIC and MID-TIER phases are complete - please continue with the ADVANCED phase.

Project Context:

Full-stack PWA for addiction recovery support with offline-first architecture
Stack: React + Wouter routing, Shadcn UI, TailwindCSS, Express backend
Design language: Therapeutic, calm, accessible (WCAG 2.2 AA compliance required)
All dependencies already installed - use only existing packages
Completed Work (BASIC + MID-TIER phases, tasks 1-7):
✅ Standardized typography hierarchy across ALL pages:

Headers: text-3xl font-semibold text-foreground mb-2
Descriptions: text-base text-muted-foreground
Header spacing: mb-8
✅ Unified spacing system:

Page containers: px-6 pb-32 pt-8
Section grouping: space-y-6
Updated pages: Worksheets, Emergency, Analytics, Meetings, Contacts, Settings, More, Resources
✅ Enhanced interactions:

Added hover-elevate to worksheet cards and interactive elements
Maintained active-elevate-2 for press states
Smooth transitions (200ms) for calm UX
✅ Responsive improvements:

Worksheets: sm:grid-cols-2 grid layout
Icon standardization: h-5 for headers, h-4 inline
All changes architect-reviewed and approved
Remaining Work (ADVANCED + DONE phases, tasks 8-14):
8. Implement Tabs for Settings/Analytics organization

Enhance visual depth: refine shadows, color contrast, dark mode
Create consistent empty states and error handling patterns
Optimize touch targets (44x44px minimum)
Add loading skeletons and async state feedback
Review accessibility: keyboard nav, ARIA labels, screen reader support
Final QA: responsive testing, consistency validation
Important Files:

DESIGN_SYSTEM_V2.md - Design system specifications
client/src/routes/*.tsx - All page components (recently updated)
client/src/index.css - Theme variables and utility classes
Key Conventions:

Follow <universal_design_guidelines> in development guidelines
Use Shadcn Tabs component for Settings page organization (Task 8)
Maintain therapeutic calm design language throughout
Test all changes before completing tasks
Notes:

Contacts.tsx has 50 LSP errors related to unimplemented warmline/SOS features (separate from design work)
App currently running on port 5000
Architect approval required before marking tasks complete
Please continue with Task 8: Implement Tabs for Settings/Analytics and proceed through the ADVANCED phase.
