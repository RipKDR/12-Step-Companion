## 1. Make it a *daily* companion, not a crisis-only tool

* Users stick around when the app helps **every day**, not just when things are bad.
* Give small daily wins: quick check-ins, reflections, coping practice, or a tiny insight in under 2 minutes.

---

## 2. Human connection is the secret sauce

* **Sponsor & peers in-app = huge for retention.**
* Build:

  * Secure sponsor chat + share step work
  * Optional peer groups / buddy system
  * Easy “check in on me if I go quiet” type accountability

---

## 3. Relapse prevention needs to be proactive, not reactive

* Track simple signals: mood, cravings, stress, skipped meetings, triggers.
* Use them to:

  * Flag **early warning signs** (“you’ve had 3 high-stress days in a row”)
  * Offer **just-in-time tools** (urge surfing, TIPP, breathing, call sponsor, meeting finder)
* “Avoid when you can, cope when you can’t” for triggers (geofences, calendar, trigger plans).

---

## 4. Crisis support must be one-tap, obvious, and calm

* Persistent **SOS / panic button** on every screen.
* When tapped:

  * Call / text sponsor or crisis line
  * Show super-simple crisis tools (grounding, breathing, safety plan)
* No buried menus. No cognitive load. Big buttons, clear options.

---

## 5. Step work + meetings = your core spine

* Digitise the Steps as **guided flows**, not just text boxes.

  * Break big steps (4, 8) into tiny sub-tasks.
  * Autosave, history, and optional sponsor review.
* Meeting support:

  * Fast meeting finder (in-person + online)
  * Favourites + reminders
  * Pre-meeting prep & post-meeting reflections

---

## 6. Privacy is non-negotiable (and a selling point)

* No shady trackers, no selling data, no surprise sharing.
* Encrypt journals/step work; optional PIN/biometric to open the app.
* Let users choose: local-only vs cloud sync; what a sponsor/partner can see.
* Default to **anonymity + first-name/alias** across everything.

---

## 7. Personalisation is good – but it must feel caring, not creepy

* Use their own data **for them**, not for you.
* Personalise:

  * Timing of notifications
  * What coping tools you suggest
  * Which triggers you warn about
* Tone: “we noticed you might be struggling, here’s support” – not “our model predicts you’ll relapse.”

---

## 8. Notifications: gentle, smart, and user-controlled

* A few **high-quality nudges** > constant spam.
* Core ones:

  * Morning “just for today” / intention
  * Nightly quick inventory
  * Known risky times / triggers
  * Milestones + wins
* Let users toggle categories + times; never guilt-trip.

---

## 9. Show progress without shaming

* Visuals that actually help:

  * Sober time & milestones
  * Mood/craving trends
  * Meetings attended & step progress
* Avoid harsh “streak reset = you’re back to zero” vibes.
* Emphasise **overall growth** (“you’ve had 50 sober days this year”, “cravings are trending down”).

---

## 10. Offline, accessible, and simple when the brain is fried

* Key stuff must work **offline**:

  * Journals, coping tools, SOS numbers, crisis plan
* Design for people who are anxious, tired, scattered:

  * Minimal UI, big tap targets, clear language
  * Works on older phones, dark mode, good contrast
* Add a special “panic mode” screen: only the essentials.
