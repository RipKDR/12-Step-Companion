## 1. Core principles for AI in a recovery app

Before features, guardrails:

* **AI as a recovery assistant, not a replacement sponsor/therapist**
* **User-written data stays theirs** – step work, journals, triggers are sacred.
* **No “we predict you’ll relapse” bullshit** – always framed as “you told me these patterns mean you might be struggling.”
* **Opt-in, explainable**: every smart behaviour is explainable (“because you logged X and Y…”), not black box.

Research-wise, AI conversational agents and “relational agents” have already shown they can reduce substance use occasions and psychological distress in SUD populations, when they feel supportive and human-ish. ([PMC][1])

## 2. Flagship AI/Agentic Features

### 2.1 Recovery Copilot: a relational “companion” built on *your* data

**What it is**

A conversational AI that actually *knows your recovery*, because it’s grounded in:

* Your step work
* Your daily check-ins / cravings
* Your “Recovery Scenes” (risky situations)
* Your meeting notes & action items

Instead of a generic mental health bot, it becomes:

* “Help me phrase this share for tonight’s meeting”
* “What patterns do you see in my last 10 cravings?”
* “Summarise my week so I can text it to my sponsor”
* “Remind me what I promised myself in my ‘Home alone at night’ scene”

**Why this is evidence-backed**

* AI conversational agents for SUD (like Woebot SUD) reduced problematic substance use and were well accepted, largely because people felt a bond with the agent. ([PMC][1])
* Meta-analyses show AI chatbots can significantly reduce depression and distress overall. ([Nature][2])

**Agentic twist**

You don’t just “talk to it.” It also:

* Prepares a **weekly digest**: “Here are 3 themes I’ve seen in your week (with your words). Want to send a summary to your sponsor or just keep it for yourself?”
* Notices recurring phrases in journals (“useless”, “burden”, “no one cares”) and gently nudges: “You often talk about feeling like a burden. Want to explore that or park it for step work?”

### 2.2 Just-in-Time Recovery Engine (personalised JITAI)

**What it is**

An engine that learns *when* and *how* to nudge you, not just *what* to say.

Inputs (that you already have / can add easily):

* Daily mood & craving check-ins
* Meeting attendance logs
* Time of day / day of week
* Self-reported triggers & “Recovery Scenes”

Outputs:

* Timely nudges like:

  * “You said Friday nights after payday are risky. Want to open your *Payday Scene*?”
  * “You’ve logged high cravings three evenings in a row. Want your Safety Plan or a meeting finder?”

**Evidence**

* Just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAIs) for addiction use smartphone data + micro-randomised trials to learn which nudges help which people *in the moment*; they’re showing promising effects for addictive behaviours and stress management. ([PMC][3])

**Agentic twist**

* The engine continuously runs tiny A/B tests *for each user*:

  * “When cravings are 7/10 at night, did ‘urge surfing’ or ‘call someone’ lead to lower cravings after 15 minutes?”
* Over time, it learns **their personal playbook** and changes the default suggestion order:

  * “You tend to do better when you **move your body** before grounding, so I’ll suggest that first in tough moments.”

This is literally JITAI + reinforcement learning, but framed as:

> “I’ve noticed certain tools work better for you in certain moments. Want me to prioritise those?”

---

### 2.3 Recovery Scenes Coach (AI that helps design situation-specific plans)

This is your most original concept from earlier, and AI can make it killer.

**What it is**

You already have the idea of *Scenes* like:

* “Home alone after 10pm”
* “On my way home from work”
* “Day after payday”

The AI helps the user build and refine each Scene playbook:

1. User types or voice-notes:

   > “Most of my using was alone at night scrolling on my phone and feeling like shit.”

2. AI turns that into structure:

   * Triggers (thoughts, feelings, people, places)
   * Early warning signs (body cues, obsessive thinking)
   * Top 3 replacement actions (walk, call, meeting, prayer, etc.)
   * A short message from “sober me” to “using me”

3. Over time, the agent:

   * Spots Scenes that are frequently involved in high cravings or slips
   * Suggests Scene tweaks:

     > “You’ve logged 4 high cravings in your *Home alone after 10pm* Scene and usually choose scrolling. Would you like to try a different first action this week?”

**Evidence backbone**

This riffs on **digital phenotyping** – using behavioural data (time, context, repeated patterns) to detect risk and tailor support. Digital phenotyping has shown promise predicting relapse and symptom change across mental health and substance use, using smartphone data like activity, sleep and usage patterns. ([PMC][4])

You’re doing a more privacy-respectful, user-defined version: they define the scenes and you *respond* to them intelligently.

---

### 2.4 Sponsor & Fellowship Assistant (AI that supports relationships, not replaces them)

**What it is**

A set of AI features specifically for sponsor/sponsee dynamics:

1. **Step Work Summariser**

   * User completes step questions in the app.
   * AI generates a **1-page sponsor digest**:

     * Main themes
     * Questions they struggled with
     * Things they want to talk about live
   * User reviews and approves before sharing.

2. **Message Helper**

   * User types messy emotions:

     > “I’m pissed off and ashamed I used last night, I don’t even know what to say.”
   * AI offers a draft text to sponsor in their own tone: honest, concise, no drama.

3. **Meeting Reflection Synthesiser**

   * User jots a few bullet points after a meeting.
   * AI structures it:

     * What hit home
     * What they related to
     * Any actions they want to take.

**Evidence**

* Chatbot-assisted interventions for substance use settings are common and often focus on behaviour change, with generally positive engagement and acceptability. ([PMC][5])
* Patients emphasise **trust, transparency, and clear roles** for AI agents in mental health – AI should augment, not replace, human relationships. ([Frontiers][6])

**Why this is a standout**

Most recovery apps ignore the real magic: **the relationship**. You’re building tools that make it easier to *be honest, organised and proactive* with sponsors and recovery friends.

### 2.5 Adaptive Coping Coach (AI that learns what actually works for *this* person)

**What it is**

You already have a Tools screen (TIPP, grounding, urge surfing). The AI layer sits underneath and:

1. Logs **what tool they used and how they felt 10–15 mins later**.

2. Builds a private “what helps me most when…” map, e.g.:

   * When: cravings 7–9/10 at night → **short intense movement + cold water** worked best
   * When: low mood + loneliness → **call + gratitude list** beat meditation alone.

3. Over time, when a similar state is detected, the app says:

> “Last time you felt like this at night and used TIPP + walked outside, your cravings dropped from 8 to 4. Want to try that again?”

**Evidence**

Personalised behaviour change based on past response is a big theme in current JITAI and mobile health research; systems that adapt the *type and timing* of intervention to the person’s state tend to outperform static ones, and clinician-controlled adaptive systems (like CBT+) show promise for tailoring CBT skills to when people will actually use them. ([BPS Psychology Hub][7])

**Agentic twist**

The coach can propose weekly experiments:

> “This week, when your cravings are 6+ at night, I’ll alternate between ‘Tool A’ and ‘Tool B’ and we’ll see which helps you more. Okay?”

This makes the user feel like they’re doing **science on their own recovery**, not just random tool tapping.

## 3. Privacy-First AI Implementation Ideas

Given you’re explicitly “privacy-first”, this actually becomes a **selling point**.

### 3.1 Where the AI runs

* **On-device where possible** for:

  * Risk scoring (simple models on SQLite data)
  * Pattern detection (e.g. “3 bad days in a row”)
* **Encrypted backend LLM** for:

  * Natural language tasks (summaries, message drafts, gentle reflections)

Research in mHealth is focusing hard on **edge and federated learning** for exactly this reason: training models without centralising raw health data. ([ScienceDirect][8])

You don’t need full-blown federated learning for v1, but the story could be:

* “Your raw journals/step work never leave your device unencrypted.”
* “If we ever train models across users, we’ll use privacy-preserving federated learning so your device only sends **model updates**, never raw text.”

### 3.2 Radical transparency

For every AI action, show:

> “I suggested this because:
> – You logged high cravings 3 nights in a row
> – You told me Friday nights are risky
> – This tool has helped you before in similar situations.”

This directly addresses known user concerns about opaque data use in mHealth. ([PMC][9])

## 4. How this plugs into the UI you already have

Without rewriting everything, you could layer AI into the current screens you’ve built:

* **Home**

  * Under `DailyCheckInCard`:

    * “AI reflection” chip: “Want a quick reflection from your companion based on this check-in?”
  * Under `SobrietyCard`:

    * “This week’s focus” generated by JITAI (e.g. “Stay connected” vs “Ask for help sooner”).

* **Tools**

  * Add “Recommended right now” row at the top – powered by the Adaptive Coping Coach.
  * After the user uses a tool, ask: “Better / Same / Worse?” – feed that into learning.

* **Meetings**

  * After they tap a meeting:

    * Prompt: “Want me to help you prep what to share?” → opens Recovery Copilot with a meeting-prep template.
  * After the meeting:

    * “Dictate how it went, I’ll turn it into a reflection.”

* **Profile**

  * Add a section: “How smart should your companion be?”

    * Toggles for:

      * Just-in-time nudges
      * Weekly pattern summaries
      * Sponsor digests
    * Clear explanations for each.

---

## 5. Pitfalls to avoid (these *will* kill trust)

1. **Creepy predictions**

   * Never: “You are at high risk of relapse in the next 24 hours.”
   * Instead: “You told me these patterns usually mean things are getting heavy. Want support?”

2. **Over-collection of passive data**

   * Don’t start with GPS/microphone/app usage scraping.
   * If you ever add them, make them:

     * Off by default,
     * Clearly explained,
     * Only used for *user-facing* value (e.g. exclusive to their Scenes/Risk plans).

3. **AI pretending to be a therapist or sponsor**

   * Always language like:

     * “I’m a digital companion, not a therapist.”
     * “This doesn’t replace meetings or your sponsor.”

4. **Endless open-ended chat with no structure**

   * People in crisis don’t need infinite text—they need **clear options and containment**:

     * SOS → 2–4 big buttons → you can offer to *stay present* via grounding / short check-in, but not drag them into long AI monologues.

## If I were shipping this…

MVP “AI/agentic” layer I’d aim for:

1. **Recovery Copilot chat** grounded in user data (journals, Scenes, step work).
2. **Just-in-Time Recovery Engine** with a simple on-device risk score + a few smart notifications.
3. **Recovery Scenes Coach** that helps define + refine those scenes and nudges them when they’re active.
4. **Sponsor Assistant** for summaries + message drafting.
5. **Adaptive Coping Coach** ranking tools by “what actually helped you”.
