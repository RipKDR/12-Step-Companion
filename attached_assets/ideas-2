**Not “a recovery app” – a Recovery Rhythm & Safety Net.**

Two things it must do better than anything else:

1. **Give you a recovery rhythm every single day** (something small but meaningful morning, midday, night).
2. **Catch you when you’re slipping** *before* you fall (early warning + safety net actions).

Everything else (meetings, step work, journaling) plugs into those two.

## Pillar 1: Daily Recovery Rhythm (micro-habits that don’t feel like homework)

I’d design the app around **3 tiny rituals** that are so low-friction people actually do them:

### 1. Morning: “Set the Tone” (30–60 seconds)

* One-card screen with:

  * “What’s your intention today?” → pick 1 of 3 options (e.g. *Stay clean*, *Stay connected*, *Be gentle with myself*).
  * Optional 1-liner: “If today gets hard, remember…”
* The intention quietly shapes:

  * Which tools are suggested.
  * What notifications you get that day.

**Why people come back:** it feels like **a quick promise to yourself**, not a form.

---

### 2. Midday: “Pulse Check” (10–20 seconds)

Think: **Tinder-simple swipe for mood & cravings**.

* One screen:

  * Mood (low → great)
  * Craving (none → intense)
  * One tap context tag: *Alone*, *With people*, *Bored*, *Stressed*, *Hungry*, etc.
* After logging:

  * If things are fine → small reinforcing message.
  * If risk is high → short, tailored suggestion: “3-minute urge surf?” / “Call sponsor?” / “Find a meeting near you right now?”

**Why people come back:** it’s **faster than opening social media**, and each log actually does something for them (not just collects data).

---

### 3. Night: “Tiny Inventory” (1–2 minutes max)

Not big 4th step work — just **one card with three quick prompts**:

* “Did I stay clean today?” (Yes / No / Close call).
* “Did I stay connected?” (meetings / sponsor / recovery friends – toggle).
* “One thing I’m grateful for / one thing I’d like to do differently tomorrow.”

Then:

* Show a **gentle trend**: “You’ve checked in X nights in a row” and “You tended to yourself even on hard days.”

**Why people come back:** it feels like closing the day with a quick **emotional toothbrush**, not a test.

---

## Pillar 2: Safety Net & Relapse Radar (without being creepy)

This is where I’d try to be original and still respectful.

### “Recovery Safety Plan” That Actually Shows Up When It’s Needed

When the user is stable/okay, they build a simple **Safety Plan**:

* “When I’m in danger, remind me of:”

  * 3 people I can call/text.
  * 3 reasons I don’t want to use.
  * 3 actions to take before I pick up (walk, shower, meeting, prayer, whatever fits their program).

Then, **the app’s whole job is to bring that plan back at the right time.**

---

### Early Warning Signals (but framed kindly)

I’d track only **simple, transparent signals** they actively give you:

* Spike in cravings.
* Dropping mood several days in a row.
* Skipped meetings if they usually go.
* Not opening the app / skipping check-ins for a few days.

When those patterns hit a threshold, the app doesn’t say:

> “We predict you’re going to relapse.”

It says:

> “Hey, you told us these patterns usually mean things are getting heavy.
> Want to bring up your Safety Plan?”

Buttons:

* **See my plan**
* **Message my sponsor**
* **Find a meeting now**
* **Do a 3-minute reset**

**Why this could stand out:** most apps either ignore this, or go full creepy-AI. This is **user-defined risk rules**, not “we analysed your soul”.

---

## Pillar 3: Sponsor & Fellowship Layer That *Feels* Like the Rooms

This is where you can win with NA/AA people specifically.

### 1. “Sponsor Mode”

A dedicated flow where a sponsor can:

* See **only what the sponsee allows**:

  * Step work they’ve explicitly shared.
  * Check-in summary (e.g., mood trends, craving frequency) – not full journal.
* Give feedback on step work with simple comments or “Let’s talk about this next call.”

From the sponsee side:

* A **“Ready for review” toggle** on each step section.
* A “Send my week summary to sponsor” button (one-tap digest, not spamming them daily).

---

### 2. “12-Step Friendly, Not 12-Step Owned”

* Optional “program flavour” on onboarding: *AA / NA / Other / Not sure yet*.
* Tailor language slightly, but keep core features universal.

**Why this can top charts:** it **respects the fellowship** instead of trying to replace it, while offering tools the official apps don’t.

---

## Pillar 4: “Recovery Scenes” – The Original Feature

This is my **most original swing**:

### Recovery Scenes = Environment-based Playbooks

Most people relapse in **patterns**: payday, late at night, alone at home, after a fight, in a certain suburb, before/after work…

I’d let users define **“scenes”** like:

* “Home alone after 10pm”
* “On my way home from work”
* “Day after payday”
* “Walking past liquor stores / dealers’ area”
* “After an argument with partner”

For each scene they define:

* **Triggers:** what tends to happen / thoughts that show up.
* **Early warning signs:** physical & emotional (tight chest, racing thoughts, fantasising, etc.).
* **Actions / replacements:**

  * “Text this friend”
  * “Don’t bring cash home”
  * “Put my phone in another room and do X”
  * “Open this grounding tool”
* **One message from “sober me” to “struggling me”** for that scene.

Then the app does two things:

1. **Manual use:** When they open the app and choose a Scene (“I’m in my ‘home alone at night’ scene”), it immediately opens that scene’s playbook.
2. **Optional smart nudges:**

   * Time-based: if it’s a known risky window (Fri payday evening) → a gentle notification:
     “This is one of your risky times. Want to open your plan for *Day after payday*?”

No intense GPS surveillance, just **opt-in context**.

**This is unique because:**
You’re not just logging triggers; you’re building **situation-specific mini-protocols** that feel very real-life. It turns the app from a journal into a **toolbox that knows which drawer to open.**

---

## Pillar 5: Incentives That Aren’t Cringe

I’d avoid “streak panic” and Candy Crush vibes. Instead:

### 1. Recovery Participation Score (Not Just Sober Days)

* A quiet score based on:

  * Days you checked in.
  * Meetings logged.
  * Coping tools used.
  * Step work progress.
* You never *lose* points for a slip; you just **gain more** by engaging.

### 2. Milestones That Include the “Messy Wins”

* Tiles like:

  * “You’ve done 30 nightly inventories.”
  * “You chose a healthy coping skill 10 times.”
  * “You reached out for help 5 times instead of isolating.”
* Not just “X days clean” — it rewards **recovery behaviour**, which still matters even if there’s a slip.

### 3. Private “Recovery Timeline”

* A calm, chronological view:
  Meetings, step work, key moods, major decisions, slips & recommitments.
* Purpose: **when someone feels like they’ve “done nothing” in recovery lately, they can SEE their effort.**

---

## Pillar 6: Make It Ridiculously Easy to Get Help *Right Now*

On every screen:

* **Floating SOS / “I’m Not Okay” button** (already in your UI – good instinct).
* When tapped:

  1. “How intense is this moment?” (slider or 3 words).
  2. Show only 3–4 giant options:

     * Call sponsor
     * Text a friend with a pre-written “I’m struggling, can we talk?”
     * See my Safety Plan
     * Crisis line

No menus, no scrolling. Big buttons, calm design.

## Pillar 7: Why This Could Actually Hit Top Downloads

If I zoom out, this product would:

* Feel **as simple as a meditation app**, but tailored to real recovery chaos.
* Be **fellowship-aware**, not generic mental health fluff.
* Offer **something genuinely new**:

  * Recovery Scenes (situation-specific plans)
  * Recovery Rhythm (morning–midday–night rituals)
  * Permission-based Safety Net instead of creepy predictions
  * Sponsor Mode that actually helps both sides

And it would give **real daily reasons to open the app**:

* Morning intention
* Midday pulse check
* Night inventory
* Quick “I’m in *this* scene, help” access
