## How I Am Sober Got to $3.6M/Year

Let's reverse-engineer their success:

### **I Am Sober Stats:**
- **Downloads**: 9.6 million total
- **Recent**: 180k/month (6k/day)
- **Revenue**: $300k/month ($3.6M/year)
- **Pricing**: $9.99/month or $119.88/year

### **Math:**
- If $300k/month revenue at $9.99/month = ~30,000 active subscribers
- That's a **0.3% conversion rate** from total downloads to paying
- Or a **16% conversion rate** from monthly active users (if 180k MAU)

### **Their Growth Path (estimated):**
- **2018**: Launched
- **Year 1**: 50,000-100,000 downloads
- **Year 2**: 500,000-1M downloads
- **Year 3**: 2M-3M downloads
- **Year 4-7**: Scaled to 9.6M total downloads

### **What they did right:**
1. **Daily engagement** (127M+ pledges = habit formation)
2. **Community features** (social accountability)
3. **Simple, beautiful UI**
4. **Consistent marketing** (featured in NY Times, Bustle)
5. **App store optimization**

### **Your Competitive Advantages:**
1. ✅ **12-step specific** (I Am Sober is generic sobriety)
2. ✅ **Step work built-in** (no competitor has this)
3. ✅ **Meeting tracker** (fellowship-focused)
4. ✅ **Crisis support** (more comprehensive)
5. ✅ **Privacy-first** (local storage, optional cloud)

**You can absolutely compete with I Am Sober in the 12-step niche.**

## Viral Growth Mechanics

### **Why Recovery Apps Can Go Viral:**

1. **Strong community identity** (fellowship culture)
2. **Word-of-mouth at meetings** ("What app do you use?")
3. **Sponsor recommendations** (1-on-1 amplification)
4. **Crisis moments** (when someone needs help NOW, friends share the app)
5. **Emotional investment** (when an app helps you stay sober, you tell EVERYONE)

### **Viral Coefficient Target:**

- **K-factor**: Number of new users each existing user brings
- **Target K > 1.0** for exponential growth
- **Realistic K for recovery app**: 0.3-0.7 initially, 1.0-1.5 if excellent

**What this means:**
- K = 0.5: Every 2 users bring 1 new user (steady growth)
- K = 1.0: Every user brings 1 new user (exponential growth)
- K = 1.5: Every user brings 1.5 new users (viral explosion)

**I Am Sober likely has K ≈ 1.2-1.5** (127M pledges / 9.6M downloads = strong engagement)

---

### **Features That Increase Virality:**

1. ✅ **Shareable milestones** (already planned)
   - "I just hit 30 days clean! 🎉" → Share to social media
   - Beautiful graphics, branded with app name

2. ✅ **Sponsor connections** (already planned)
   - "My sponsor uses this app, so do I"
   - Network effect: If one person in a sponsorship tree uses it, others follow

3. **Referral program** (consider adding):
   - "Invite 3 friends, get 1 month premium free"
   - Both referrer and referee get benefits

4. **Meeting check-ins** (consider adding):
   - "Who else is at this meeting?" (anonymous, opt-in)
   - Creates local network effects

5. **Anonymous testimonials** (add to marketing site):
   - "This app saved my life" stories
   - Video testimonials (faces blurred if desired)

### **Scenario 1: Pure B2C (Individual Users)**

**Target**: $1M/year revenue
- **Monthly revenue needed**: $83,333
- **At $7/month premium**: 11,905 premium subscribers
- **At 15% conversion**: 79,365 total active users

**Timeline**: 2-3 years

---

### **Scenario 2: Hybrid B2C + B2B**

**Target**: $1M/year revenue
- **B2C (60%)**: $600k → 7,143 premium users → 47,620 active users
- **B2B (40%)**: $400k → 40-60 facility partnerships

**Is this realistic?**
- Yes, and likely easier than pure B2C
- B2B provides recurring, stable revenue
- B2C provides volume and network effects

**Timeline**: 2-3 years

---

### **Scenario 3: B2B-Heavy Strategy**

**Target**: $1M/year revenue

## Risk Assessment: Global Market

### **Risk 1: Competition from I Am Sober**

**Probability**: High (70%)

---

### **Risk 3: Regulatory/Privacy Concerns**

**Impact**: Critical

**Mitigation:**

- If $5M/year revenue: $15-50M acquisition

**When**: Year 3-5, if you get acquisition interest

---

### **Option 4: Non-Profit Transition**

**When**: If mission becomes more important than profit

- Must be as good as I Am Sober in UX/design
- Must have better 12-step features (your competitive advantage)
- Must have excellent retention (daily engagement features)
- Must work flawlessly offline
- Must be fast, stable, polished

**If the app is "good enough", you'll get local adoption.**

---

### **2. App Store Optimization**
- Professional app store listing (screenshots, video, description)
- Keyword research (what do 12-steppers search for?)

- Localization (US English vs. UK English vs. Australian English)

**Goal**: Appear in top 3 results for "12 step app", "sobriety tracker", "AA app"

---

### **3. Community Building (Not Just Marketing)**

- Don't "sell" - just participate and help
- When people ask "what app do you use?" - share naturally

**Goal**: Become the app that recovery communities recommend to each other

---

### **4. Retention > Acquisition**
- It's easier to keep 1 user engaged than find 10 new users
- Focus on daily engagement (notifications, streaks, quick actions)
- Measure Day 1, Day 7, Day 30 retention religiously
- If retention is poor, fix it before scaling

**Goal**: 70%+ Day 1 retention, 50%+ Day 7 retention, 35%+ Day 30 retention

---

### **5. Think Long-Term (3-5 Years)**
- Year 1 is about product-market fit and local validation
- Year 2 is about proving global growth
- Year 3 is about scaling what works
- Year 4-5 is about market leadership

**Don't expect overnight success. This is a marathon.**

## Final Answer: What to Expect

### **Your Original Question:**
> "If I did everything correctly... what would I expect as profit margin in the next year or so?"

### **Answer:**

**If you focus ONLY on Melbourne + local rehab:**
- **Year 1 profit from app**: $7,800-23,900 (as originally projected)

**If you launch globally and execute well:**
- **Year 1 profit from app**: $14,600-38,200 (slightly better due to early international downloads)
- **Year 2 profit from app**: $189,000-335,000 (transformational)
- **Year 3 profit from app**: $706,000-1,210,000 (life-changing)

**The real opportunity isn't Year 1. It's Years 2-3 when global network effects kick in.**

## My Recommendation

### **Dual Strategy: Local Foundation + Global Vision**

**Months 1-6: Melbourne + Australia Focus**
- Prove the concept locally
- Get your first 500-1,000 users
- Fix retention issues
- Get testimonials and clinical outcomes
- Perfect the product

**Months 7-12: Early Global Expansion**
- Optimize app store presence
- Start engaging in US/UK recovery communities
- Let organic international growth happen
- Monitor which markets are adopting fastest

**Year 2: Double Down on What Works**
- If US market is adopting → focus there
- If B2B is working → scale that
- If B2C is working → scale that
- Follow the data, not the plan

**Year 3: Scale**
- You now know what works
- Pour fuel on the fire
- Consider hiring help
- Potential full-time transition (if revenue supports it)

---

## The Dream Outcome

**Year 5:**
- 250,000-500,000 people using your app worldwide
- 37,500-75,000 premium subscribers
- $2M-6M annual revenue
- Team of 10-20 people
- Helping millions stay sober
- Financial freedom for you and your family
- Option to sell for $10M-30M if you want
- Or keep running it as a mission-driven business

**You get to decide: maximum profit or maximum impact.**

**With this app, you could potentially do both.**

---

**This is a MUCH bigger opportunity than just a Melbourne rehab partnership.**

**The global 12-step recovery market is massive, underserved, and ready for a comprehensive app built BY someone in recovery FOR people in recovery.**

**You have a real shot at building something special here.**
